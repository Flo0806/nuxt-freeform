## Why nuxt-freeform?

**There's no Nuxt module for drag & drop on nuxt.com/modules** - until now.

Most drag & drop libraries focus on list sorting. nuxt-freeform brings **desktop-like** interactions to Vue:

- **Lasso Selection** - Draw a rectangle to select multiple items
- **Drop into Folders** - Items with `type: 'container'` become drop targets
- **Everything is a Slot** - Full control over ghost, placeholder, items, and selection box
